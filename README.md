Description

Pediatric brain cancer is the 2nd most common type of brain cancer and the deadliest. In previous studies, machine learning algorithms have been shown to be better predictors of survivability than traditional methods. 
This project uses data from SEER to create a machine learning algorithm to predict if a pediatric patient with a brain tumor will survive based on variables such as patient demographics and tumor characteristics.
